The abstract discusses the connection between urban planning and how pedestrians move and behave in metropolitan areas, which directly relates to understanding and influencing human mobility patterns. Urban planning can significantly impact the efficiency, safety, and accessibility of pedestrian pathways, all of which are crucial elements of human mobility in urban contexts. Therefore, the study's focus on these interactions makes it highly relevant to the topic.\n"
